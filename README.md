This project involves the development of a web-based Student Grade Management System to manage courses, evaluations, and results. The system is divided into six key stages, each focusing on a specific functionality, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient user experience:

Étape 1 – Database Creation
Designed and implemented tables for Courses, Evaluations, and Results.
Ensured appropriate data types and established clear relationships between tables to support data integrity and efficient queries.

Étape 2 – Grade Entry Page
Dynamically fetched course and evaluation lists from the server.
Used loops in PHP to populate <select> elements for efficient form management.
Validated grades before insertion, stored them in the Results table, and displayed a confirmation message upon successful submission.


Étape 3 – Detailed Grade View
Retrieved grades from the server using precise SQL queries.
Leveraged PHP loops for displaying grades in a structured and readable manner.
Ensured all relevant information (courses and evaluations) was visible, with no output for evaluations missing grades.


Étape 4 – Global Grade View
Calculated global grades either using T-SQL queries or within the PHP code.
Utilized PHP loops for displaying global grades with associated courses.
Only displayed complete courses (with three grades), ensuring clarity in the global overview.



Étape 5 – Homepage and Navigation Menu
Developed a homepage as the system's entry point.
Implemented a navigation menu accessible across all pages for seamless user interaction.

Étape 6 – Grade Update Functionality
Facilitated easy selection and update of grades for existing courses and evaluations.
Ensured the update process was intuitive and displayed a success or failure message after the operation.
This system prioritizes functionality, user-friendliness, and data accuracy, making it a robust solution for managing student grades effectively.# Project-Description-Student-Grade-System
